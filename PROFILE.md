# **Hello, I'm Eaint! 👋**

### I'm an entrepreneur and marketing expert currently learning the wizardry of data science and machine learning at Caltech CTME's bootcamp.

After 8 years of slinging spells in the digital marketing realm, I decided it was time to level up my skills. I'm now training to become a data sorcerer so I can use my powers for good.

When I'm not studying, you can find me dreaming up my next business idea or getting lost in a good drama. I love working on projects that make a real difference in people's lives.

- Brewing up some sweet statistical analysis and modeling 📊🔬
- Conjuring data pipelines and architectures 🧪🔧
